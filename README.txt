A simple Raycaster for Android. Eventually I'll do something useful with it.

For now, touch the screen to move around.

Coming in the near future:

- Textures.

- Sprites.

- Multi level walls.

- Lighting.

- Doors.

- Levels.


Wall Textures from: http://findicons.com/icon/177327/wall#

BUGS

- Off by one (I think) when casting one side. This makes some walls not intersect, not good!
